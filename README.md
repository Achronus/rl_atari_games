# Reinforcement Learning with Atari Games
This repository focuses on exploring how Intrinsic Motivation (IM) effects Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy-based models. 
We use a Rainbow Deep Q-Network (RDQN) to simulate off-policy and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as on-policy. 

We focus on three IM methods: curiosity, empowerment and surprise-based motivation, and evaluate their performance on three Atari games: 
Space Invaders, Q*bert, and Montezuma's Revenge. Our research aims to provide intuition on how IM methods affect these popular on-policy and off-policy agents.
